# UI/UX Design Coursework by Parv Patel

Welcome to my **UI/UX design coursework portfolio**, a collection of projects that showcase my process of researching, ideating, wireframing, and prototyping to solve real-world user experience challenges.  

Each project highlights different aspects of user-centered design — from redesigning digital products to conceptualizing new experiences.

## Projects Overview

| [**Chase Banking App Wireframes**](./Chase_Wirefram,e.pdf) | Low-fidelity Wireframe | Finance usability, user flows, accessibility | Balsamiq |
| [**Myntra App Redesign**](./Myntra.pdf) | Wireframe | E-commerce navigation, checkout flow | Mocqup tool |
| [**Hope of Child Concept App**](https://www.figma.com/design/lJ7KiJ6c3Y6viBI5aKjWTe/HopeOfChild?node-id=0-1&p=f) | Concept Design | Child empowerment, parental dashboard | Figma, Notion |

## Design Process

Every project followed a **human-centered design approach**:

1. **Empathize** – Understand user pain points through observation and secondary research.  
2. **Define** – Identify usability issues and opportunities for improvement.  
3. **Ideate** – Brainstorm creative, feasible solutions to address the pain points.  
4. **Prototype** – Translate ideas into low or high-fidelity mockups in Figma.  
5. **Test & Iterate** – Gather feedback and refine based on user responses.
